## Design Pattern Basics

### OO Basics

* **Abstraction** - Just know how to drive a car , not what comprises the car;
* **Encapsulation** - Hide your car's internals, with body panels;
* **Polymorphism** - Different brand of accessories for your car which perform same basic function with tweaks;
* **Inheritance** - Where was this car derived from ; Ancestral properties;

### OO Principles

* **Encapsulate what changes.**
* **Favor composition over inheritance.**
* **Program to interfaces, not concrete classes.**
* **Strive of loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.**
* **Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification**
* **[more to come]**
  

### OO Patterns

* **Strategy Design Pattern** - define a  family of algorithms , encapsulate each one, make them interchangeable, based on a client algorithm varies;  
* **Observer Design Pattern** - define one to many dependencies between objects so that when object changes state, all its dependent objects are notified and updated automatically.
* **Decorator Design Pattern** - attach additional responsibility to an object dynamically.**
* **[more to come]**
